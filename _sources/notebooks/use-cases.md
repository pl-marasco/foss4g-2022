# Showcases

In this section, you can find notebooks to showcase simple scientific use cases. We have used them to build the training material for the FOSS4G workshop. Each of them has a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and have been tested on Pengeo EOSC. All are distributed under an MIT license and we would appreciate you cite them whenever you use them for your own work. 🙏
